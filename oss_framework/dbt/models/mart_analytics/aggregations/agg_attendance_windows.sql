-- NOTE: fact_attendance provides annual-grain summaries (one row per student
-- per academic year) with aggregate counts (days_enrolled, days_present, etc.).
-- The Aeries SIS API returns annual attendance summaries, not daily records.
-- All window types below use the annual data as the best available proxy.
-- When daily attendance data becomes available, this model should be updated
-- to compute true rolling windows.
